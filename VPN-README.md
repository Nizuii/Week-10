# What is a VPN

- **VPN** stands for virtual private network.
- It establishes a secure and reliable network connection over an unsecure network such as internet.
- It protects the internet activity and disguises the identity of the user on internet.
- Without VPN the network traffic will be going through the ISP server, which means that the ISP can see and log all of the users internet activity. So typically they can see all the websites user visited.
- A VPN will disguise users identity y hiding the IP address.
- A VPN can also encrypt and protect the internet data of the users.
