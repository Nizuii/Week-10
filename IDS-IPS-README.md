# What is IDS/IPS

- **Intrusion Detection System** & **Intrusion Prevention System** are 2 critical network security tools used to protect systems & networks from cyber threats.
- While they both aim to safeguard against cyber attacks, they differ in how they operate and the actions they take.

## IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

- **IDS** is a hardware or software tool that monitors and analyzes network or system activities for sign of unauthorized access or policy violations.
- It passively scans incomming traffic and compares it to pre-configured  or behavioral patterns.
- **IDS** alerts the system admin when potential threaths are detected but does not take any active action to block or mitigate them.
