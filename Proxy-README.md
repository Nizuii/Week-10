# What is a Proxy Server.

- Retrives data on the internet on behalf of the user.
- It means basically a proxy server acts as a middle man between the client and the web server.
- It provides privacy that means it allows you to surf the internet anonymously because it hides your IP address.
- Without using proxy your public IP address is visible.
- But with a proxy, your public IP address is not visible because as the proxy server is retriving the web page for you only the IP address of the proxy server can be seen viewing the web page.
- Proxy also provides speed because
- So if a company uses a proxy server and when ever a user wants to retrieve a web page the proxy server will retrieve a web page from the internet on the behalf of the user and then it will store that webpage into a centralised cache database. So if another user on a different computer goes to a webpage that has been stored in a proxy database, the proxy server doesnt have to go to the internet to retrieve the web page because i can simply retrieve the webpage from its database and send it to the user.
- Another benefit of proxy is activity logging. A lot of companies will use the proxy to keep track of what websites the employees looking at. And also the company can use proxies to block certain websites to keep their employees from visiting them.
- But a proxy cannot encrypt the data like VPN does.
